# BossTrack - GPS Tracking & Trip Management App

A React Native application for GPS tracking and trip management with real-time location services, user authentication, and cloud data storage.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **Complete Implementation**
- **Real GPS Tracking** - Native device GPS with automatic fallback to simulation
- **User Authentication** - Registration, consent management, session handling
- **Trip Management** - Start/stop trips with automatic location recording
- **Cloud Integration** - Supabase backend with comprehensive mock mode
- **Location Quality Monitoring** - Real-time GPS accuracy indicators
- **GDPR Compliance** - User consent tracking with timestamps

### 📱 **User Experience**
- **Seamless Onboarding** - Consent collection with user data registration
- **One-Tap Tracking** - Simple trip start/stop with automatic data capture
- **Real-Time Feedback** - Live GPS status and location quality indicators
- **Testing Tools** - Built-in GPS testing and diagnostics

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development with zero compilation errors
- **Supabase** - Cloud database and authentication
- **iOS CoreLocation** - Native GPS integration
- **Redux-Free Architecture** - Clean service layer design

## 📋 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- React Native CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- CocoaPods

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BossTrack.git
cd BossTrack

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Set up environment (starts in mock mode)
cp .env.example .env

# Run the app
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Development Mode
The app runs in **mock mode** by default, providing full functionality without requiring a real Supabase backend. Perfect for development and testing!

## 🔧 **Production Setup**

For production deployment with real Supabase backend:

1. **Follow the [Production Setup Guide](PRODUCTION_SETUP.md)**
2. **Create Supabase project and configure database**
3. **Update `.env` with real credentials**
4. **Set `SUPABASE_MOCK_MODE=false`**

## 📖 **Documentation**

- [**GPS Integration Guide**](GPS_INTEGRATION.md) - GPS implementation details and testing
- [**Completion Summary**](COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md) - Project status and achievements

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
node test-integration.js

# Test GPS functionality
./test-gps.sh
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Consent Flow** - Complete user registration through consent screen
2. **GPS Tracking** - Test real GPS with quality indicators
3. **Trip Management** - Start/stop trips and view data
4. **Settings** - Use built-in GPS testing tools

## 🏗 **Architecture**

### Service Layer
- **SimpleAuthService** - User authentication and consent management
- **SimpleTripService** - Trip recording and location tracking
- **SimpleSupabaseService** - Cloud data storage with mock mode
- **LocationService** - Native GPS integration with fallback

### Components
- **SimpleApp** - Main application with authentication flow
- **SimpleConsentScreen** - User registration and consent collection
- **SimpleTrackingScreen** - GPS tracking with real-time feedback
- **SimpleSettingsScreen** - GPS testing and status monitoring

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security**

- **GDPR Compliant** - User consent with timestamp tracking
- **Row Level Security** - Supabase RLS policies for data protection
- **Permission Management** - Intelligent GPS permission handling
- **Environment Security** - Sensitive credentials in environment variables

## 📊 **GPS Quality Indicators**
